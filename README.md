### Reflection

This assignment was pretty simple. I had fun getting the servo to work too. I'm not the best at coding but I had lots of help with this assignment. One thing I struggled with though was getting the things I needed from the adafruit libraries, it's a bit more complex as to what I'm used to coding with. I learned a little more about how to wire up a servo which was helpful. I'd say in the future, make a list of all the things the code needs before you start writing it.

## CircuitPython Distance Sensor

### Description & Code

Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm.

Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, and green when its 35cm.  Ignore the blue and 20cm for now, let's just keep it simple.

For your final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance.

### Reflection

In this assignment I had to wire up the ultrasonic sensor and make it tell me the distance of an object from it using the serial monitor in CircuitPython. This assignment was a bit easier since I had a concept of how it works from last year. I still had lots of help with it though because of all the files and copying/pasting. I learned more about how to code the serial monitor to tell me values from the sensor. If you ever wired one up, I suggest using the serial monitor the most you can.

## CircuitPython Motor Control

### Description & Code

Wire up a 6v battery pack to this circuit with a motor.

Write Python code to make the motor speed up and slow down, based on input from a potentiometer.

### Reflection

This assignment was a bit difficult for me since it involved the potentiometer. I had to find all the correct example file that I need to use in Circuit Python which made it difficult. Again, I had help from experts and it worked pretty well.

### Reflection

This assignment was also pretty easy. I had fun helping others with the assignment too. I did have trouble figuring out the weight problems but I had help with that and figured it out.

### Reflection

This Onshape part was easy to make. It was very simple and thew blueprints were clear. Using the blueprints make everything so much easier and I had fun challenging myself.
