### Reflection

This assignment was pretty simple. I had fun getting the servo to work too. I'm not the best at coding but I had lots of help with this assignment. One thing I struggled with though was getting the things I needed from the adafruit libraries, it's a bit more complex as to what I'm used to coding with. I learned a little more about how to wire up a servo which was helpful. I'd say in the future, make a list of all the things the code needs before you start writing it.

## CircuitPython Distance Sensor

### Description & Code

Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm.

Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, and green when its 35cm.  Ignore the blue and 20cm for now, let's just keep it simple.

For your final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance.

### Reflection

In this assignment I had to wire up the ultrasonic sensor and make it tell me the distance of an object from it using the serial monitor in CircuitPython. This assignment was a bit easier since I had a concept of how it works from last year. I still had lots of help with it though because of all the files and copying/pasting. I learned more about how to code the serial monitor to tell me values from the sensor. If you ever wired one up, I suggest using the serial monitor the most you can.

### Reflection

This assignment was a bit difficult for me since it involved the potentiometer. I had to find all the correct example file that I need to use in Circuit Python which made it difficult. Again, I had help from experts and it worked pretty well.

### Reflection

This part was very easy to make. The blueprints are very simple. I started of by sketching the biggest side of the part and extruded it so I could get the main base of the part. Then I added all of the details to it in order to finish making the part. My advice when making these parts is to always start with the biggest side or the side that makes the base of the part. It makes this much easier to do when adding the other details.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty cool. It was simple to make as well. Using the add on for challenge parts was cool because I could see the part on the same studio that I was working in. I noticed a lot of people use circles instead of arcs though. If I were to help anyone I would tell them to make sure they're using the center point arcs for the slots instead of a full circle.

### Reflection

This was a cool assignment. It was fairly easy and the blueprints were simple. I liked how it started with a beginning piece to build off of. If I were to help anyone making this, I would say both sides of the fillet/arcs on the holder and plate pieces aren't the same on each side. For example, the outside arc is offset of the inside arc so the radius isnt the same for both. The outside could be 10 and the inside could be 7.

## Locking Plier Assembly Practice

### Reflection

This assignment was fairly easy compared to the rest of the assignments. It was good practice for me because I don't use assemblies that much even though I should be. I learned how to calculate the center mass using a mate connector which was pretty helpful. To anyone who were to do this assignment, I'd say watch the videos on it. They were really helpful so I included the links for both videos:
