# CircuitPython
This repository will actually serve as an aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```



**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.

## Multipart Design

### Assignment Description

Make a copy of this document.Links to an external site.

Rename the and replace COpy with your name.

Create all of the parts needed for the assembly.  The cylinder is given as a starting point.
 
Answer the 4 questions below.  There is a question about the initial assembly and then one for each of the three revisions to the product.

You should be able to complete this assignment in 1 hour.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

### Reflection

This Onshape part was easy to make. It was very simple and thew blueprints were clear. Using the blueprints make everything so much easier and I had fun challenging myself.
